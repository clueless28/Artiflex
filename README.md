# Artiflex: AI-Powered Promotional Banner Generator

Welcome to **Artiflex**, an AI assistant designed to help you create promotional banners and content effortlessly. Using AI-driven image processing and text inpainting, this tool allows users to upload product images, select from predefined offers, and optionally enter prompts to generate promotional content.

### Current Solution
In the current workflow (MVP at the time of submission), the system takes in three inputs:  
1. **Prompt (text)**  
2. **Product image**     
3. **Offer selection (preset list)**  

The application extracts a mask from the product image and applies a preset offer font image according to the selection. These elements are placed within a preset layout. This layout is then provided as input to a **stable diffusion model**, which designs the banner according to user inputs such as theme, gradient, and overall look.

#### *Not in scope:*
1. Dynamic layout
2. Refined prompt
3. Conditioned generative AI
4. Multiple products per banner
